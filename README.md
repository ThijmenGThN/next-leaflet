### Deployment - GitHub Actions

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

> **IMPORTANT** The CI/CD workflow for next-leaflet has been setup in a way where it'll connect to any VPS via SSH as defined in the Repository Secrets.

1. Prepare your VPS.

    1. Install the required dependencies:

        - [Docker](https://docker.com/get-started/)

2. Configure your runner.

    1. Within Github navigate to 
        
        ` Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions `

    2. Create the following repository secrets:

        Name|Expects|Description
        -|-|-
        SSH_KEY|Private Key|Generate a new ssh key without a password.
        SSH_HOST|IP Address|The address of your server with an Actions (runner) active.
        SSH_USER|Username|Host system user where next-leaflet should be deploy on.
        SSH_PORT|Port Number|This usually refers to the default ssh port 22.
        APP_ENV|Environment|A copy of .env.sample with adjusted values for deployment.

3. Enable the workflow.

    1. Designate a trigger branch within the ` .github/deploy.yml ` file.

        > Any change pushed to the targeted branch should now trigger a request to deploy next-leaflet via docker-compose on the designated VPS.
